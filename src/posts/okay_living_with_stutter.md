I’ve been having a stutter since my childhood. From Grade 1 of elementary school, I began to notice that I had difficulty speaking fluently in front of people, regardless of the complexity of the sentences, the social situation, or how many times I practiced beforehand.
I could still remember those embarrassing moments when I stuttered in front of my whole class at school, the long and awkward pauses during conversations, being mocked by classmates, and spending the next few days recovering before ready to see people again. I stuttered less at home, but when I did, there came the blame and shame, and sometimes scolding from my well-meaning parents.

There were good days and bad days. While the problem was barely noticeable on my good days, bad days happened more often. There’ve been stretches of good days when I thought I had gotten rid of it for good, but every single time it relapsed.
Then I immigrated to Canada at the age of 15. Learning to speak in a different language did not reset or ameliorate my speech impediment. It even became exacerbated, because of the unfamiliarity of the new language and social environment.

At some point during my adolescent years, I began to realize that I might have to deal with it for the rest of my life. Anger, fear and confusion floated in my mind. How will I handle social demands when I become an adult? Will I succeed in a job interview? Will I be able to function effectively at workplace? Will I find someone who is interested in a romantic relationship or marriage with a guy who stutters? Is it even worth the risk of asking a girl out, if sooner or later she will find out this unfixable flaw and reject me?

Then my worries became real. Throughout my high school and university years, I experienced anxiety in various social situations (especially in groups), and struggled to form new relationships. I got the most interviews among my class in our internship competition, but was the last one to secure a placement. I was too scared to actively pursue romantic relationships. And when opportunities came up, fear and low self-esteem got the best of me. While my peers were making new friends, enjoying social activities, and seeking personal development, I chose to spend my spare time sitting on my couch, watching TV and playing online games alone, trying to hide this embarrassing flaw from as many people as I could.

The symptoms haven't been improving much at all; however, then came a few new experiences in my life that have gradually changed my attitude.

In the fall of 2015, I received a wonderful opportunity to work as a master’s research student at <a href="https://hollandbloorview.ca/" target="_blank">Holland Bloorview</a> Kids Rehab Hospital, an academic hospital that advances health research, and provides care and advocacy for children and youth living with disability. While working there as a (regular) research student, I was instilled with lots of new perspectives (such as <a href="https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2016/11/28/doctors-notes-stop-portraying-childhood-disability-as-tragic-or-inspirational.html" target="_blank">this one</a>) and heard many inspiring, relatable stories (such as <a href="https://foundation.hollandbloorview.ca/Why-Give/qa" target="_blank">this one</a>) from people living with disability, including my own research participants who lost their legs in car accidents. Moreover, I adopted the <a href="https://hollandbloorview.ca/about-us/hospital/mission-vision-impact" target="_blank">values</a> of courage and resilience, learned the importance of role models, self-advocacy, and the use of social media as an equal, inclusive space for individuals with disability to express themselves.

The people and culture at Holland Bloorview are amazing. I got invited to represent all students to speak at an all-staff meeting. I also received trust from my supervisor to lead lab tours for guests and stakeholders. I got to face my biggest fear, and did what I used to think I couldn’t do or forbidden from doing. I started to realize what I had been told before are lies. No, stuttering in public is not unacceptable or shameful, even in professional settings. Rather, having the courage to face my fears and giving my best efforts deserve praise and respect. There was also no shortage of love and support from my <a href="http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/researchcentreslabs/propellab/ourpeople" target="_blank">labmates</a>. I didn’t feel any judgement working with them. Everyone learned to use a little extra patience while listening to me speak, focused on the content and not the pauses, never appeared annoyed or made fun of it, and offered me words of encouragement after a rough day.

Earlier this year, I had my first dating experience. During a date night, anxiety arose, and I had a hard time conversing at the dinner table. On the ride home, I thought this was the end as she probably didn’t like me stuttering this much. Just when I was apologizing to her, she turned to me and said “that’s okay”, “it was still a good time”, “everyone has a bad day” …and then enthusiastically agreed to have our first kiss. It was the sweetest night I ever had. Although the relationship didn’t last long for other reasons, the little confidence and validation I gained from this experience still go a long way.

Oh, I have discovered a wonderful sport called running. I treat running as an alternate playing field of life, one that is simpler and free of barrier. Meanwhile, I have been exploiting running as a social tool, building friendships, and enjoying group memberships through involvements with running clubs. Running allows me to worry less about talking to people and let the sport itself do work on human bonding. Together, we follow the same training program, share the same goals, races, (training) places and paces. Our similarities as runners make it easier for us to look past our differences as individuals.

Through self-reflection, I realized that overcoming this unique challenge has brought me unique strengths. During the time I couldn’t find people to talk to, I learned to use positive self-talk to recover from setbacks. Repetitive exposure to my fears has made me comfortable with being uncomfortable, and grown my courage and resilience. My vulnerability could lead to more satisfying relationships as it increases intimacy…
During my next job interview, and on my next first date, I won't be afraid to talk about it when the time is right. I am okay living with it now, because I have started to believe that with a little more courage and resilience, I could still live a normal, happy, and fulfilling life.
