On August 26-29, 2018, I attended <a href="https://archive.asme.org/events/idetccie2018#:~:text=IDETC%2FCIE%202018%20will%20highlight,throughout%20the%20product%20life%2Dcycle." target="_blank">ASME IDETC/CIE 2018</a>, an international engineering research conference in Quebec City to present the work I did for my master’s thesis. As a former research student entering the tech industry, this was my first time and likely last time participating in a conference of this kind. Here’s a recap of my experience:

<ins>Preparation</ins>
Conferences to academics are like meets to athletes - an opportunity to celebrate hard work and success, and network with like-minded individuals. This conference was hosted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), an internationally renowned professional engineering association. My anticipation was high when my lab decided to participate as a group.
I submitted my paper manuscript back in March after refining my master’s thesis work. The reviewers’ feedback was overall quite positive, and it felt like I got accepted by a comfortable margin. My next few months were filled with a mix of additional research/publishing, and career transition to become a software developer. August arrived before I knew it. I put together my presentation, rehearsed it over, and was ready to go. I traveled and roomed with Emerson, a labmate of mine whose paper also got accepted to present at the conference.

<ins>Conference</ins>
There were four days of events in the conference <a href="https://archive.asme.org/events/idetccie2018/program" target="_blank">program</a>, with many options to choose from each day.

On Day 1, I opted for a tour of Laval University’s robotic laboratory, and a career development workshop. The most fun activity came in the evening of Day 1. Students were divided into teams and competed in a design contest, where each team ideated an innovative (and mostly impractical) technology solution for increasing professors’ productivity, and then pitched it to the judges. Each of the top 8 teams wins a gift card to go for dinner together. This sounds like super fun, but sadly we missed it due to being stuck at an early event.

The next three days were filled with research talks. At each timeslot there were about 15-20 sessions going on concurrently, so it was hard to decide on which one to go to. Some were hour-long keynote speeches by leaders of the field, while others were shorter presentations (20 min each) and poster sessions by master’s and PhD students. The attendees were well spread out. As a result, many sessions including my presentation weren’t well attended.

During a coffee break, I was approached by a conference organizer who was at my talk. After hearing that I was job hunting, he delightfully offered me a job referral at his company in Detroit, Michigan, which made me feel validated for my work. However I wasn’t interested in relocating. I also went to talk to a girl (from Queen’s University and about to move to Toronto) who presented at the same session as me, eventually took the plunge and asked for her number, and was politely turned down.

<ins>Networking</ins>
The conference attendees/presenters were diverse coming from different parts of the world. I met people from the US (most), China (2nd most), South Korea, and Western European countries. Plenty of networking opportunities were available: at breakfasts, coffee breaks, receptions, workshops, poster sessions… Meeting new and interesting people wasn’t difficult. Making meaningful connections that could last beyond the four-day conference however, was. For this reason, I prefer local conferences where geographic proximity, shared network and culture enable a better sense of community and more meaningful connections.

<ins>Leisure</ins>
I got to spend a good deal of my time in Quebec City with Emerson. Both of us were keen on exploring restaurants in the city, so we went out to a few different places on evenings. Dining out creates the ambience for good conversations. We don’t share a lot of similarities, but we connected with each other quickly by being open about our life struggles and goals, as well as touchy but important subjects such as privilege, racism, disability and inclusion from our own perspectives.

<ins>Final Take</ins>
At the end, it wasn’t as great as I had anticipated. The stress from my upcoming job interviews, being far removed from my master’s thesis work, the lack of sense of connection with other attendees, a combination of these, made this a slightly underwhelming experience. What I enjoyed the most, was sharing the same room, exploring restaurants, and having candid conversations with Emerson. For five days we were the closest friends to each other. All in all, it was definitely the right decision to go, because I knew I would likely never get a chance to do this again.
